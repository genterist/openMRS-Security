## Abuse Cases ##

· Use Case Name: A simple, intuitive name that uniquely identifies the use case.

· Iteration: Façade/filled/focused/finished —how refined the description is.

· Summary: One-two sentences describing the interaction occurring in the use case.

· Basic course of events: The steps that the actors and the system go through to accomplish the goal of this use case, the most common path taken.

· Alternative paths: Less common paths than the basic course.

· Exception paths: Paths taken when errors occur.

· Extension points: Steps in the use case from where extending use cases diverge.

· Triggers: The entry criteria for the use case, i.e., what initiates it.

· Assumptions: Conditions assumed to be true (but which cannot be guaranteed by the system itself) for the use case to be executed normally.
· Preconditions: Conditions that must be true before the use case can be performed.

· Postconditions: What will be true after the use case has been completed.

· Related business rules: Declarative business rules related to the use case.

· Author: Who wrote the use case.

· Date: When it was written.


## Misuse Cases ##

· Name: Just like normal use cases, every misuse case should have a distinguishing name.
· Summary: One or two sentences should describe the interaction performed.

· Author: Whoever wrote the misuse case.

· Date: When it was written.

· Basic path: This will be the normal path of action taken, ending with success for the misuser and thus failure for the system and its owners.
