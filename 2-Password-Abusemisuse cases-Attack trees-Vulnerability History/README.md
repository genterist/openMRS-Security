# Milestone 2 #

## Password Strength ##

Describe OpenMRS’s password policy.  You should describe minimum and maximum password length, allowable characters, number of allowable character categories (e.g., numbers) required, password age, password reuse policy, and account lock out. 

You should also provide links with evidence for each of these policies where possible, or indicate that you looked at the code directly or experimented with creating new passwords for each policy.

## Abuse/Misuse Cases ##

Develop an misuse and abuse case diagram for one of the modules of OpenMRS (your choice) which involves the creation of a use case diagram with which the misuse and abuse cases interact with.  Be creative and as complete at possible considering the various types of malicious actors that would like to abuse the chosen module and what they would want to do as well as benevolent users that make mistakes.

For four (4) of the abuse and misuse cases in your diagram, write a detailed abuse case description using the template discussed in class.  The intent is that each person on the team would write one detailed description so the number of descriptions you turn in matches the number of people on your team.  At least one case must be an abuse case and at least one case must be a misuse case.  Please indicate on each description the name of the author.

## Attack Trees and Protection Trees ##

Develop an attack tree and a protection tree for your targeted module. Where appropriate, include information on the tools required for each step in both process (no tool required, etc.), and a projected cost for each attack/protection scheme. These can be estimates; however, try to justify your choices with citations, evidence, etc.

Roughly 15 points per tree and the justifications/citations/descriptions for each.  The logic and substantiation for your justification is important.

## Vulnerability History ##

Describe, in a broad sense, the vulnerabilities that the product has had in the past by searching the Internet. 

Cite your URLs where you found the information. Feel free to include code snippets and specific examples. 

Is there any evidence of how these vulnerabilities were found?

Are these commonly-occurring vulnerabilities?

How do you think OpenMRS had to fix the vulnerability?
