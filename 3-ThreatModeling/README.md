In this folder, there are:

1.  Abuse/Misuse Cases 
We develop an abuse case diagram for one of the modules of OpenMRS (TBD) which involves the creation of a use case diagram with which the abuse cases interact with. We consider the various types of malicious actors that would like to abuse the chosen module and what they would want to do.
For four (4) of the abuse cases in our diagram, we write a detailed abuse case description.

2.  Attack Trees and Protection Trees
We develop an attack tree and a protection tree for our targeted module. We also include information on the tools required for each step in both process (no tool required, etc.), and a projected cost for each attack/protection scheme. These are estimates based on citations, evidence, etc.

3.  Security Requirements
We develop 10 security requirements for OpenMRS spreading over several modules
