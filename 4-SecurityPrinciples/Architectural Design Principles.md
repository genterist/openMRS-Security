### ADP01
Least Privilege : A subject (user/other system) should be given only those privileges it needs to complete its task.

Test Step:
* Step 1: Login as System admin(sysadmin).
* Step 2: Then enter Appointment Scheduling and click Manage Service Types.
* Step 3: Click New Service Type then copy the url.http://localhost:8082/openmrs-standalone/appointmentschedulingui/appointmentType.page
* Step 4: Log out and Login as an clerk.
* Step 5: Paste the url and then you will find you can manage the service type as a clerk.

Result: Failed. As we can see, the privilege of a clerk only include manage appointments, daily appointments and appointments required. Service type is not a function that the clerk can manage.

Solution: The system should manage the access control using something like Role Based Access Control instead of url access. The system should check the role on both client and server side.

### ADP02
Donâ€™t allow modification or access without a trace : Users should not be able to add, edit or delete data without the action being logged. Moreover, the log file should log who takes the action.

Test Step:
* Step 1: Login as admin(admin).
* Step 2: Then click Find Patient Record.
* Step 3: Click on an existing Patient Record.
* Step 4: Delete this patient.
* Step 5: Check if there are log files which has monitored who delete this patient.

Result: Failed. The log file only records the delete reason and fail to record who delete this patient. Moreover, the log file use seperate log lines to record one delete action. This would make mistakes when multiple user are using the system. The system doesn't recognize who delete the patient.

Solution : Log files should remember the user who click on every add, delete or other changes on the database. The delete function should be the same with add or save in the log files regards the Argument. So the log files related to delete function should be In method PatientService.voidPatient(this is better to be deletePatient). Argument: user = "", Patient = "", String = "".

### ADP03
Quiet Your Error Messages : Attackers can cause system errors intentionally to gather information about the system. Error messages should be minimalistic, without giving details on the failure.

Test Step:
* Step 1: Login as admin(admin).
* Step 2: Click register a patient.
* Step 3: Delete the appId part of the url. http://localhost:8082/openmrs-standalone/registrationapp/registerPatient.page
* Step 4: See if there are some detailed error message.

Result: Failed. There are detailed error message about the source code. The hacker can try multiple error to get the logic and detail about the source code.

Solution: The system should only return a simple error message without showing any detail about the code. E.g. 404 Error.
