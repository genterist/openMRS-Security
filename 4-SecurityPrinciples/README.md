In this section, we evaluate the following principles

1) Architectural Design Principles
We list three examples of architectural design principle violations in OpenMRS. Where possible, we will provide test cases for each example. If there's not an associated test case, we will describe the design principle violation and how we would fix it in a few paragraphs.

2) Usable Security Principles
We list three examples of usable security principle violations in OpenMRS. Where possible, we will write test cases for each example. If there's not an associated test case, we will describe the usability principle violation and how we would fix it in a few paragraphs.

3) Protection Poker
We recommend new functional requirements for OpenMRS to add functionality that is not in the system yet and rank security risk for each table and requirement.

4) Bug Fixes
We will submit bug fixes to OpenMRS
