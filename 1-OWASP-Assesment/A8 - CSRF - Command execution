### * Description
#### Name of module : OpenMRS help page
A different page will embed a link to OpenMRS. While the link appears to be normal (going to a known good site - the OpenMRS site), once the user clicks on it, it will launch an attack to the server under the logged in identity of the user. 

### * Precondition
1. A local computer with administrator privilege
2. Java JRE installed
3. OpenMRS Standalone Version 2.6.0 downloaded and unziped
4. A connection to the internet

### * Dependencies
1. OpenMRS with demo database was loaded and runs normally
2. Good connection to the internet

### * Test Data
http://localhost:8081/openmrs-standalone/adminui/myaccount/changeDefaults.page?lang=ZAP%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%0

### * Test steps
1. Open up OpenMRS V. 2.6.0 Standalone. Make sure Tomcat Port is 8081 and MySQL port is 3316. A web page starting with localhost:8081 will be automatically opened upon successful start.
2. Go to "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_iframe"
3. At the W3School page, replace the value of iframe src with "http://localhost:8081/openmrs-standalone/adminui/myaccount/changeDefaults.page?lang=ZAP%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%25n%25s%0" without the double quotes and click the "Run" button.

4. Observe the result on the right iframe

### * Expected results
In the iframe, OpenMRS server will give an internal server error message
HTTP Status 500 - Request processing failed; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException ...

### * Post-condition
The OpenMRS service should still be able to run normally

### * Actual results
In the iframe, OpenMRS server gave an internal server error message
